📘 ArEEG: Arabic Inner Speech EEG Dataset & Decoding Pipeline

This repository contains our undergraduate thesis project at The American University in Cairo, where we investigate the decoding of Arabic imagined speech (inner speech) from EEG signals.
The project includes the codebase, experiments, documentation, and models developed as part of our thesis work.

The dataset used is the ArEEG: An Open‑Access Arabic Inner Speech EEG Dataset, publicly available here: GitHub / Eslam21/ArEEG
