# 🚨 **Why This Project Matters**

Individuals with **ALS**, **Locked-in Syndrome**, or severe paralysis often lose the ability to speak.
Brain–Computer Interfaces (BCIs) offer a way to restore communication by decoding the **silent inner voice** directly from the brain.

However, major challenges exist:

* 🇬🇧 **Almost all existing datasets are English-only**
* 🔊 **EEG signals are noisy and non-stationary**
* 🧠 **Models struggle to generalize across subjects**
* 🇸🇦 **Very limited research exists for Arabic imagined speech**

✨ This makes **ArEEG the first open-access Arabic inner speech EEG dataset**, enabling more inclusive BCI research.

# 🔑 **Key Features of Our Thesis**

## 🧠 **EEG Imagined Speech Decoding**

We develop pipelines for preprocessing, feature extraction, and deep-learning-based decoding.

---

## 📚 **Five Arabic Commands**

**Up**, **Down**, **Left**, **Right**, **Select**

---

## 🏗 **Complete Processing Pipeline**

* Preprocessing (filters, ICA, re-referencing)
* Feature extraction (PSD, FFT, Wavelets, ERP)
* Deep learning models (CNN, LSTM, Transformers)
* Evaluation (cross-subject & within-subject)

---

## 🧪 **Reproducible Experiments**

All code will be published here as the thesis progresses.
